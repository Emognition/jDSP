 * <h1>Finite Impulse Response Filter Class using Least Squares Minimization</h1>
 * The FIRLS Filter class is used to compute the best coefficients of the linear phase FIR filter using least squares minimization
 * for the specified band and their desired gains.
 * This class extends to the abstract class _FIRFilter which also allows for computing the filter output for an input signal.
